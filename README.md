Twine, as in "intertwine" (or as in string that's kind of like rope in that it's made up of lots of other string, but in every other way is nothing like rope), is a proprietary application of Mauna Kea, inc., a company I made up. It centralizes project management and communications within the company, to facilitate interdepartmental collaboration and to keep the allocation of budget to third-party apps minimum.
